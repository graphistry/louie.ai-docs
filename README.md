# Welcome to the Louie.ai documentation

Louie.ai is the first genAI-native investigation platform. It combines:

* **Louie:** A pluggable neurosymbolic AI agent that understands your data, connects to your tools, and learns with your team
* **AI notebooks:** Use natural language, queries, and code to investigation, create, and automate
* **AI dashboards:** Create reusable data tools, including generative AI steps like summaries
* **API:** Work with Louie and its systems headlessly such as for automation and custom apps
* **Batteries included:** Growing list of native database connectors of different types (graph, log, SQL, vector),  MCP for many APIs, and standard Python/containers for custom packages

Use Louie.ai from our managed cloud service, self-host from all public clouds, or run on-prem, including air-gapped.
