# Signing In to Louie Desktop

Once you've installed Louie Desktop, you'll need to sign in to access your account, data connectors, and team resources.

## First-Time Sign In

The first time you launch Louie Desktop, the authentication process is simple and secure:

1. **Launch Louie Desktop** - Open the application from your Applications folder or launcher
2. **Browser Opens Automatically** - A new window will open in your default browser, directing you to the Graphistry sign-in page
3. **Enter Your Credentials** - Log in using your Graphistry username and password
4. **Authentication Complete** - Once authenticated, you can close the browser tab
5. **Return to Louie Desktop** - The desktop application will automatically detect your successful authentication and complete the sign-in process

The browser-based authentication ensures your credentials are handled securely through Graphistry's authentication servers, and your password is never stored locally in the desktop application.

## Staying Signed In

Louie Desktop will keep you signed in between sessions. Your authentication is securely stored using your system's keychain.

### Session Management
- Sessions remain active for 30 days
- Sessions refresh automatically while you're using the app
- You can sign out at any time from the profile menu

## Troubleshooting Sign In Issues

### Browser Doesn't Open
If the browser window doesn't open automatically:
- Check your system's default browser settings
- Manually open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in Louie Desktop
- Ensure no firewall or security software is blocking the connection

### Can't Remember Password
1. On the Graphistry sign-in page, click "Forgot Password?"
2. Enter your Graphistry username or email address
3. Check your email for a password reset link
4. Follow the link to create a new password
5. Return to Louie Desktop and try signing in again

### Authentication Fails
If authentication doesn't complete:
- Ensure you're using the correct Graphistry credentials
- Check that you have an active internet connection
- Try closing Louie Desktop completely and relaunching
