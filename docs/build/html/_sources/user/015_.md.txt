# Running Blocks

Running blocks in Louie.AI is a streamlined process that lets you write commands, select tools, and execute analysis while monitoring progress in real-time.

## Workflow Overview

The block execution process follows these key steps:

1. **Command Entry**: Write your analysis request or command
2. **Tool Selection**: Choose the appropriate tool from the tool picker
3. **Title Configuration**: Edit the block title if needed
4. **Execution**: Run the block and monitor progress
5. **Review Results**: Inspect the output and decisions made

## Real-time Monitoring

As your block runs, you can:
- **Watch Progress**: See real-time updates on execution status
- **Monitor Decisions**: Observe what Louie.AI is thinking and deciding
- **Track Processing**: Follow the step-by-step analysis process
