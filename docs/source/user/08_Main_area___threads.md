# Main Area and Threads

Threads are the primary workspace in Louie.AI where you can organize your data analysis workflows. The main area provides access to your threads, connectors, and organization settings.

## Key Concepts

- **Threads**: Individual analysis sessions that contain blocks of commands and their outputs
- **Main Area**: The central interface for accessing and managing threads
- **Connectors**: Data source connections that provide access to your databases and APIs

Threads help you organize your work and collaborate with team members by keeping related analyses together.
