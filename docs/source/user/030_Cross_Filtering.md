# Cross Filtering

Cross Filtering

Dragging a selection within a chart will create a filter that is applied across all charts that read from the same dataframe. (Double click to clear selection)

Affected charts will have the filters visible in a tag at the top of the panel, as well as within the "Filters" options at the top of the page.

Cross filtering within a Dashboard does not affect the Notebook view. These filters are not persistent and are lost on page refresh.

Clear (double click)
