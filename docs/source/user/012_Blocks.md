# Blocks

Blocks are the fundamental units of work in Louie.AI. Each block represents a command or query and its corresponding output.

## Block Features

- Execute commands in natural language or specific syntax
- View results directly below the command
- Examine the AI's thought process and decisions
- Interact with outputs through visualizations and data tables
- Edit, delete, or expand blocks as needed

Blocks can be chained together to create complex analysis workflows, with data flowing between them to build comprehensive insights.
