# Input Groups

Input Groups

Creating an Input Group can be done by clicking on the [icon] within the notebook. Examples of each input type will be added by default. (Toggle, Text, and Slider)

Configure the input group by modifying the JSON, and then use the parameters within your queries by prefacing the name with a colon (i.e. :country, :date, :count, etc).

Add the input group to a panel like you would any other output element.

When in the Dashboard view, interacting with the inputs will automatically update the queries and their respective panels.
