![Louie Logo](./images/Louie_logo.png)

Louie.a is a GenAI-first data analysis platform designed for investigations. It spans a learning agentic AI, AI notebooks, AI dashboards, APIs, and coming soon, AI workflows. Connectors are key, with an automatic semantic layer spanning native databases like Splunk, Databricks, AWS Neptune (graph), SQL, and coming, any MCP-capable one. Louie UI features include Graphistry GPU graph visualizations, GPU GIS visualizations, accelerated charting with cross-filtering, and embedding. Louie has  both low-code editing and custom code capabilities, e.g., secure Python sandbox.

## Louie combines:

* **Louie:** A pluggable neurosymbolic AI agent that understands your data, connects to your tools, and learns with your team
* **AI notebooks:** Use natural language, queries, and code to investigation, create, and automate
* **AI dashboards:** Create reusable data tools, including generative AI steps like summaries
* **API:** Work with Louie and its systems headlessly such as for automation and custom apps
* **Batteries included:** Growing list of native database connectors of different types (graph, log, SQL, vector),  MCP for many APIs, and standard Python/containers for custom packages

Use Louie.ai from our managed cloud service, self-host from all public clouds, or run on-prem, including air-gapped.
